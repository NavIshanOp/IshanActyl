# Install Guide

Warning: You need Pterodactyl already set up on a domain for Heliactyl to work

2. Unarchive the file and set the server to use NodeJS 16
3. Configure settings.json (specifically panel domain/apikey and discord auth settings for it to work)
4. Start the server (Ignore the 2 strange errors that might come up)
5. Login to your DNS manager, point the domain you want your dashboard to be hosted on to your VPS IP address. (Example: dashboard.domain.com 192.168.0.1)
6. Run `apt install nginx && apt install certbot` on the vps
7. Run `ufw allow 80` and `ufw allow 443` on the vps

- You can check if Heliactyl is running in background with `pm2 list`
- Once you confirmed that Heliactyl is running in background, you can create a startup script by running `pm2 startup` and `pm2 save`
- Note: Supported init systems are `systemd`, `upstart`, `launchd`, `rc.d`
